# 🟢 Node.js Static File Server

This is a basic static file server built using **Node.js** without any external libraries. It serves HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files based on the incoming request.

  - `index.html`
  - `.css`, `.js`, `.png`, `.jpg` files
- Returns a custom 404 page if a file is not found
- Clean MIME type handling
- Emoji-friendly response (`utf-8` support)

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** or copy the files into your folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaibkundi2/NodeJS-Practice.git
   cd Nginx-server

2. Run the server 
```bash 
node index.js

3:Visit in browser:

copy and paste it.
http://localhost:3000
or 
http://localhost:3000/contact.html
http://localhost:3000/about.html
or then you can make your own ...
```

But if url does not exist then it will show error
```bash
404: Page not found 😥 
```
